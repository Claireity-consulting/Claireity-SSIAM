# Claireity-SSIAM

## A Swift-based **S**elf-**S**ervice **I**dentity and **A**ccess **M**anagement application in development!

A white paper and proof of concept will be published soon. I'm a solo-dev with very little time on my hands, but you can now try the initial Swift package skeleton.

Meanwhile, check out the very first wireframe & presentation of the application for more insight into the project!
